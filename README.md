# FitApp

I’m currently building this demo —  Work in Progress.. 

A strict **diet tracking app** designed for fitness enthusiasts. Everything is pre-defined and aligned to a specific goal (starting with bulking).

This app is inspired by the bodybuilding lifestyle where nutrition is everything. It draws influence from:
- Pro athletes & fitness creators
- Popular supplement and clothing brands
- Personal training & strict bulk/cut programs
- (Coming Soon) mockups, Figma links, or screenshots.

# Features
- **Macro Calculator:** Automatically calculates macros based on weight and goal (e.g., bulk, cut, maintenance).
- **Food Tracker:** Logs every meal with a fixed food list.
- **Shopping List:** Shopping list of all foods included in the plan.
- **Fitness Blog:** Tips, recommendations, and links to trusted resources & brands (e.g., Bridman, Raw, Bum, Dragon Pharma, GNC, Gymshark, YoungLA, Dfyne, IG fit clothing profiles).
